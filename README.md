## ðŸ“† Lesson Calendar Subscription Feeds
### How do I use these?
In the table below, there are links to WebCal feeds (.ics calendar feeds) you can use to get events happening at the Library automatically added to your calendar. To subscribe to a calendar, "right-click" on the feed you want and then copy and paste the URL (or "link address") for the feed into your calendar program of choice.

How to actually add the subscription depends on your calendar program:

On Google Calendar, you'll need to go to "other calendars" in the sidebar and add a new calendar "From URL."
On Apple's Calendar program, go to File --> New Calendar Subscription in the toolbar.
